# 8 Ways to Reduce E-Commerce Checkout Fraud Using FraudLogix

Checkout is one of the highest-risk points in the e-commerce funnel. Fraudsters test stolen cards, automate attacks, exploit promotions, and hide behind VPNs or proxies—creating a costly mix of chargebacks, revenue loss, and customer friction.

FraudLogix helps merchants strengthen this vulnerable step using real-time IP intelligence that identifies risky sessions before authorization and improves approval rates for legitimate buyers.

## 1. Stop Card Testing Bots Before Authorization

Card testing attacks often originate from automated scripts or low-cost botnets. FraudLogix surfaces high-risk IP traits such as:

- VPN or proxy use  
- Tor exit nodes  
- Cloud and hosting providers  
- Rapid, repeated requests from rotating IPs  

By flagging these indicators in real time, merchants can block testing attempts before they reach authorization.

## 2. Reduce Account Takeover (ATO) Checkout Fraud

Account takeover attempts typically use IPs with known fraud behavior or automation patterns. FraudLogix detects:

- High-risk or previously flagged IP addresses  
- Bot-driven login attempts  
- New device + suspicious IP combinations  

Merchants can then step up verification selectively, reducing friction for trusted customers.

## 3. Block Promo, Coupon, and Incentive Abuse

Fraudsters often exploit one-time promotions using disposable accounts or automated tools. FraudLogix identifies:

- Multiple accounts funneling through the same IP  
- Proxy and VPN activity hiding user geography  
- Anonymized traffic patterns tied to abuse  

This helps enforce promo rules without negatively impacting genuine customers.

## 4. Mitigate Return Fraud & Reshipper Abuse

Return-fraud actors and reshippers frequently conceal their true location. FraudLogix highlights:

- Geography mismatches between IP data and user claims  
- Offshore data-center activity  
- Traffic routed through anonymizers  

These insights allow merchants to better screen return or high-value orders.

## 5. Add Real-Time IP-Level Scoring to Checkout Decisioning

FraudLogix provides an IP Risk Score for each checkout attempt, allowing merchants to categorize:

- **Approve** low-risk sessions  
- **Challenge** medium-risk sessions (3DS, SMS, KYC)  
- **Block** high-risk or extreme-risk sessions  

This improves fraud prevention while maintaining high approval rates.

## 6. Detect VPNs, Proxies, Tor, and Data Centers Used for Fraud

Checkout fraud is often facilitated by anonymized infrastructure. FraudLogix identifies:

- VPN endpoints  
- Public or private proxy services  
- Tor nodes  
- Hosting providers tied to automated attacks  

These signals help merchants apply friction only when necessary.

---

## 7. Identify Automation Using Behavioral & Network Intelligence

FraudLogix goes beyond static IP traits by analyzing deeper behavioral patterns such as:

- High request velocity across multiple websites  
- IP clusters associated with historical fraud  
- Automation-like traffic signatures  
- Suspicious volume within narrow IP ranges  

This dynamic intelligence enhances risk scoring and improves fraud-detection accuracy.

## 8. Enforce Fraud Controls at the Infrastructure Layer

For merchants with large traffic volumes, FraudLogix blocklists can be integrated directly into:

- WAFs  
- CDNs  
- Reverse proxies  
- Load balancers  
- Payment gateways  

This prevents high-risk IPs from reaching checkout pages altogether, reducing system load and improving platform security.
